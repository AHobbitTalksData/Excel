I created this database from samples associated to a research I have been a member of. Because of this, I will not explain further the topics associated to the data or how they were recolected as these results are pending to be published. However, as a generalization, the data is associated to some paintings located at the National Theater of Costa Rica.

As for the validation and the processing of the data: I homogenized the data for each category by making sure that they followed the same format, I provided a name for each category so that any person can understand what is being presented in the document and can continue adding new records. As this last part, the new records are restricted as some columns have specific rules to ensure the homogenization of the data. For example, in some cells there are dropdowns and, in others, the records have been categorized as dates and the new records can only be dates.
